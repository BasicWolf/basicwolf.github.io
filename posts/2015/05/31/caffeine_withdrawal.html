  <div>
    <div class="section" id="it-all-started">
<h2>It all started...</h2>
<p>It all started long before I turned two years old. I started drinking tea!
Properly saying, I drank whatever was in the bottle and no one asked
my opinion. Drinking tea is an Azeri tradition, you will be offered tea
everywhere, at any meeting, gathering or reception, party or mourning and
many other occasions. Speaking of, that is not a <em>tea from a teabag</em>, no sir!
It is a properly brewed tea almost at a boiling point of water.
The taste is great and is fully-flavoured.</p>

<p>I have been drinking coffee since university. Tea was not enough to
sustain my brain during the nights before exams (how stupid that sounds today!).
Then, I turned to energy drinks. What a perfect example of how
cheap caffeine tablets are sold in a form of overpriced liquid!</p>
<p>Nevertheless, tea was my favourite in the family of hot drinks. I drank
coffee occasionally and had an energy drink or two, couple times
a month.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="getting-hooked-up">
<h2>Getting hooked up</h2>
<p>Lately I noticed obtaining a new &quot;drinking coffee at work&quot; habbit.
I had a cup of coffee in the morning right after logging in.
I had another cup right after lunch and usually the third cup
just before leaving home.</p>
<img alt="A cup of coffee" class="align-center" src="https://zaurnasibov.com/articles/2015_05_31_caffeine_withdrawal/caffeine_withdrawal_coffee.jpg" />
<p>The side effects came out rather quickly: Drinking coffee for
productivity turned into drinking to feel normal. I could not
start a day without coffee anymore. I started getting sleepy
in the evenings, as I did not drink any coffee at home.</p>
<p>Finally, I decided to stop drinking anything with caffeine
in it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="detox">
<h2>Detox</h2>
<p>There are great caffeine detoxing advises on
<a class="reference external" href="http://caffeineinformer.com">caffeineinformer.com</a>.
I chose the <cite>The Cold Turkey Method</cite> i.e. ceased
consuming caffeine at all. In a retrospective, that was a
naughty move. The detox process went as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Day I</strong>: Running nose and irritating headache. Hard to
think and hard to move. I had to take a doze of ibuprofen
painkiller to ease the symptoms.</li>
<li><strong>Day II</strong>: Headache and running nose continues. Severe
muscles pain started to build around back of the neck.
Another single doze of ibuprofen. I'd take paracetamol instead,
but most of those painkillers are mixed with caffeine.</li>
<li><strong>Day III</strong>: Headache is not as bad, muscles are still
suffering. No painkillers today.</li>
<li><strong>Day IV</strong>: Headache is almost over. Nose is lightly running.
Muscles pain starting to fade.</li>
<li><strong>Day V</strong>: Feeling much better. Headache is completely gone,
I had to do some exercise to completely get rid of muscles
pain, or rather turn it into a rewarding post-exercise
itch.</li>
</ul>
<img alt="Inside caffeine withdrawal" class="align-center" src="https://zaurnasibov.com/articles/2015_05_31_caffeine_withdrawal/caffeine_withdrawal_inside.jpg" />
<p>That was it! My body got back to normal, I did not need
coffee or tea to wake up or feel good. My brain was
completely cured from the caffeine addiction.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="afterwards">
<h2>Afterwards</h2>
<p>That was not the end of the it yet! I opted to drink only water
for three more weeks. It was almost summer, the weather was warm
thus, no need to warm up by drinking something hot. These weeks
went fine. I only noticed consuming more water than before.
Eventually I started drinking tea again. Coffee was left as a
&quot;brain doping&quot; which I'm willing to take only when it is really
required.</p>
<p>Do you have any withdrawal experience? I'd be glad to hear your
story! If you want to try (though I'd hardly recommend it :)

and caffeine interaction.</p>
