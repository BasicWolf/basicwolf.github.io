<h2>Longing for improvement</h2>
<p>Are you familiar with the gut feeling that the software development
practices around you could be better?
Sometimes the desired improvements are small and obvious.
They are not very hard to implement and have a quick return of investment.</p>
<p>For example, adding a vulnerability scanner to a CI pipeline prevents using
dependencies with known CVEs.
A code formatter which applies the rules for every source file save operation -
brings determinism and keeps team members from nagging about style.
Even a low disk space alarm configured long time ago
could save you from major embarrassment and business losses.</p>
<p>Other improvements are not that easy.
Core dependencies being dramatically outdated since new versions break
compatibility?
Painful deployment with downtime lasting for days?
Features being developed by single developers for months and living in a branch
for all the that time?
Backlog growing indefinitely.
Bugs, bugs and even more bugs pouring in every day?
I'd be glad to tell that the above is a horror story, and it never happens in
reality. But you and I both know the sad truth.
Worse - when everyone in the development
department agrees that something should be done, but the time is never right.
Thousands of software businesses have to deal with stories like this every day.</p>
<p>There is no silver bullet to fix all the issues in your organization.
But we are not armless in the matter.
What if you don't need to guess what should or could be improved?
What if there is a solid scientific study on practices of
high performing technology organizations?</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="accelerate">
<h2>Accelerate</h2>
<p><strong>Accelerate</strong> by Nicole Forsgren, Jez Humble and Gene Kim is a book concluding
a four-year research into capabilities and practices
of software development practices.
There were over 23000 survey responses from over 2000 unique
and diverse organizations from around the world collected during the research.
It uncovered 24 key capabilities that drive improvement in
software delivery performance. Some of these capabilities are:
<strong>continuous delivery</strong> and <strong>trunk-based development</strong>,
<strong>loosely coupled architecture</strong> and <strong>customer feedback</strong>,
<strong>work-in-progress limits</strong> and <strong>transformational leadership</strong>.</p>
<img alt="Accelerate book cover" class="align-center" src="https://zaurnasibov.com/articles/2021_06_23_accelerate/accelerate_cover.jpg" style="width: 40%;" />
<p>&quot;Accelerate&quot; doesn't have all the answers and is not a guidebook.
But it clearly describes the differences between low and high -performing
organizations and teams. It explains in detail how capabilities are related
and how each capability affects performance and
how leadership is essential for transformation.
Being said, not every capability is easy to measure.
You can quickly estimate how long it takes to deliver a committed piece of code
to the customer. But how do you measure culture?</p>
<p>The second part of the book may help you find the answer.
While the first part is about the study results, it's the second part which
explains the methods used in the research and dives deep into the science
behind conducted surveys.</p>
<p>The third part is a life example story of ING  Netherlands.
It tells how leadership, management, and team  practices work together
bringing a traditional banking business into the digital age.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="verdict">
<h2>Verdict</h2>
<p>There is no verdict. This book is truth based on facts.
Although not a long one, my career has been among low, average and great
performing teams.
I mentally applied everything said in the book to my experience,
and boy it is accurate!
There is really no excuse for an organization to ignore this study or
delay applying the practices ASAP.
If you want to stay in the game, you have to <strong>Accelerate</strong>.</p>
