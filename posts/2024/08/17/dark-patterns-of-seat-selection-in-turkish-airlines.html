    <p>Turkish Airlines is our first choice when it comes to flying to Azerbaijan from
Finland. It’s not the cheapest, but the service is great. You get good food
even in economy class, and there is an entertainment system with a broad selection
of movies to keep you and the kids busy. The baggage allowance is huge - 30kg
for check-in and the standard 8+kg for carry-on, although I’ve never seen them
put the carry-on baggage on scales.</p>
<p>So, what’s all the fuss about?</p>
<img alt="Dark Turkish airlines logo" class="align-center" src="https://zaurnasibov.com/articles/2024-08-17-dark-patterns-of-seat-selection-at-turkish-airlines/turkish-black-logo.webp" />
<div class="section" id="ticket-prices-gone-wrong">
<h2>Ticket prices gone wrong</h2>
<p>It started in mid-spring when we were checking ticket prices for Helsinki-Baku flights.
The figures were crazy, to say the least. Since we were also planning
a summer trip to Estonia, we decided to check the price from Tallinn.
Bingo! Twice as cheap. There are roughly 100 km between Tallinn
and Helsinki (Vantaa) airports. The distance doesn’t justify it.
Helsinki airport tariffs are certainly higher than Tallinn’s, but not that much!
So, the good old supply and demand: if Turkish Airlines can sell the tickets
for that price, why go lower? It’s summer season after all,
and Finns are rushing to warm countries.</p>
<p>This ticket price talk is rather a rant. After all, the route is not monopolized;
one can fly, for example, Air Baltic when on a strict budget. However,
I wanted to emphasize that the tickets are not cheap, and considering
all the services included, the dark patterns are not something you would expect.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="seat-selection-gets-weird">
<h2>Seat selection gets weird</h2>
<p>For years, we had a default seat arrangement where either all of us sat together,
or (after our youngest daughter was born) 3 + 1, making it possible for both kids
to sit with either mom or dad.</p>
<p>But on the flight from Tallinn to Istanbul (our first leg), the seats
were split as 2 + 2. This was on an Airbus 321 (or Boeing 737, I can’t remember exactly)
where economy class has a 3 + 3 seat configuration.</p>
<p>Well, the kids have grown up enough to sit alone with either parent,
so it’s truly not a big deal, right?
But that was the first subconscious bell - have Turkish Airlines updated their
algorithms?</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="seat-selection-gets-worse">
<h2>Seat selection gets worse</h2>
<p>Two days before going back to Finland, we got an email:</p>
<img alt="Your seat have been changed screenshot" class="align-center" src="https://zaurnasibov.com/articles/2024-08-17-dark-patterns-of-seat-selection-at-turkish-airlines/your-seat-have-been-changed-screenshot.webp" />
<p>The all-caps subject is certainly emphasizing. What's inside?</p>
<!--  -->
<blockquote>
<p>Dear ZAUR NASIBOV</p>
<p>Your seat selection on the 10 AUGUST TK0339 Baku (GYD) -Istanbul,Istanbul (IST)
has been changed to 11F due to operational reasons.</p>
<p>For details and seat transactions to your *** reservation, you may visit our
MOBILE app / WEBSITE Air.tk/manage-booking.</p>
<p>Thank you for your undestanding.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Who said that I am <em>undestanding</em>? Because I was not understanding,
neither I did want to. Upon checking the seats I saw this:</p>
<img alt="New seats" class="align-center" src="https://zaurnasibov.com/articles/2024-08-17-dark-patterns-of-seat-selection-at-turkish-airlines/seats-changed.webp" style="width: 40%;" />
<p>What the... Has someone reserved both <tt class="docutils literal">D</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">E</tt> seats in row 10 or 11?
Perhaps all the seat pairs and triplets are taken, and there is no way to
accommodate us closer to each other? Let's check the rows at the tail:</p>
<img alt="Empty seats at the tail" class="align-center" src="https://zaurnasibov.com/articles/2024-08-17-dark-patterns-of-seat-selection-at-turkish-airlines/empty_tail_seats.webp" style="width: 40%;" />
<p>So many unreserved seats! Yet, instead of keeping us together ten rows
further to the tail, the algorithm decides to split us in the most annoying way.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="support-can-t-do-anything">
<h2>Support can't do anything</h2>
<p>I had some hope that support might help with the problem. Although caring, the
operator could do nothing, since the seat reservations were not paid for -
they were &quot;randomly assigned&quot;. According to the operator, I could either
pay for the desired seats or... request better seats while checking in at the
airport.</p>
<p>Frequent fliers know too well that nowadays the chances of ending up at the
very tail of a plane are increasingly high when checking in at the airport.
Usually, passengers check in via airline apps hours before the flight
to secure their seats. And just few years ago, selecting seats while checking
in was free of charge, at least with Turkish airlines. Not anymore.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="five-stages-of-grief">
<h2>Five stages of grief</h2>
<p>Twenty four hours before the flight, I am awake early to check in via the app.
<em>Sure, you can pick the seat! Only 14 Euros per passenger!</em></p>
<img alt="Selecting seats is not free anymore" class="align-center" src="https://zaurnasibov.com/articles/2024-08-17-dark-patterns-of-seat-selection-at-turkish-airlines/check-in-seats.webp" style="width: 40%;" />
<p>Denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance - all happening within
a blink of an eye. It is not about the money; 14 Euros is what lunch costs
in Finland. It was really a question of principle. First, they spread people
from a group (read: family members) across the rows, and now they make us pay
to get back together. And you know what? That’s ingenious!
Because I paid that money so that we don’t end up scattered even more
or at the last rows in the tail. Bravo, Turkish Airlines, you’ve discovered
a dark well of gold!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="bad-luck">
<h2>Bad luck?</h2>
<p>Perhaps I’m wrong. Perhaps it’s just bad luck. On the second leg of the journey,
our seats were on the same row: <tt class="docutils literal">B, C, D, E</tt>. Imagine my surprise when the
neighboring passengers from seats <tt class="docutils literal">A</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">F</tt> asked to change places
because they were a mother and daughter flying together!
(Note: This is a crafted screenshot; I didn’t take a screenshot of these seats back then).</p>
<img alt="Our seats on the second leg" class="align-center" src="https://zaurnasibov.com/articles/2024-08-17-dark-patterns-of-seat-selection-at-turkish-airlines/seats-second-leg.webp" style="width: 40%;" />
</div>
<div class="section" id="aftermath">
<h2>Aftermath</h2>
<p>Will I stop flying Turkish Airlines? Let’s see what next year brings :)
As a passenger, I despise dark patterns like this and would rather pay extra
from the start to have a pleasant experience, instead of getting
“YOUR SEAT HAS BEEN CHANGED!11!!!11” emails.</p>
