    <!-- started writing on 2025-07-17 -->
<p>As I am writing this text, enjoying Finnish summer from an armchair in my backyard,
a feeling of satisfaction fills me. After nine years with a home desktop machine,
I'm finally back to using a personal laptop. I can once again work on my projects
from anywhere - from a sofa in the living room or an airplane 10 km above the ground.
&quot;Good for you, Zaur, you've got a laptop, why are you so excited?&quot;
Let's go back a few years ago. It all began with a loud rant...</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="https://zaurnasibov.com/posts/2025/07/20/framework-laptop-is-awesome.html">
<img alt="Framework Laptop" class="align-center" src="https://zaurnasibov.com/articles/2025-07-17-framework-laptop-is-awesome/img/framework-cartoon.webp" />
</a>
<div class="section" id="a-rant-about-a-broken-screen">
<h2>A rant about a broken screen</h2>
<p>&quot;...Dammit! I <strong>did</strong> cut that antenna cable! Well, there's still one left.
Damn Lenovo and all modern electronics manufacturers!&quot; - I cursed
every second of the two hours it took me to disassemble and reassemble
my better half's IdeaPad to swap
the broken screen. She had accidentally closed her laptop lid with a smart card
reader cable lying on the keyboard — resulting in the lower-right quarter
of the screen dying.</p>
<p>&quot;<em>Replacing a laptop screen — how hard can it be?</em>&quot;</p>
<p><strong>It can be quite hard</strong>. That's because nowadays we design electronics for
fast production, not <em>easy repairs</em>. Even when the broken component is not
soldered into the motherboard, you need a ton of luck to find a replacement
part and fix things. You won't find any official manuals — perhaps only videos
made by kind people on Youtube.</p>
<p>In my case, I had to
disassemble the chassis from both the top and bottom,
use a hairdryer to loosen the glued screen frame,
unfasten dozens of screws,
deal with fragile antenna cables (and yes, I ended up smashing and cutting one!).
All this — by following a video guide bought from a random Australian
laptops repair shop!</p>
<p>That's when I promised myself: next time I buy a laptop, it's gonna be the
most repairable laptop out there. Little did I know, the Framework Laptop
had already been on the market for two years!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="imagine-a-laptop">
<h2>Imagine a laptop</h2>
<p>Imagine a modern, <strong>sustainable</strong> laptop. It should be designed to last,
be easily customisable and repairable.
That's the Framework Laptop in a nutshell.
It all starts at the web shop. Would you like a pre-built laptop with Windows,
or a DIY edition with components in separate boxes and no OS installed?
- Your choice!
Are your daily needs specific to two USB-A ports and an Ethernet port?
Sure thing!
Don't like the official memory and storage? Bring your own!
Want a display with a higher refresh rate? You've got it!
And that's just the tip of the iceberg.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<img alt="Framework Laptop configuration" src="https://zaurnasibov.com/articles/2025-07-17-framework-laptop-is-awesome/img/framework-configuration.webp" />
<p class="caption">Configuring <strong>your</strong> Framework Laptop.</p>
</div>
<p>The experience continues as you own it.
Is your display broken? The <a class="reference external" href="https://guides.frame.work/Guide/Display+Replacement+Guide/86">official manual</a>
will guide you to replace it in just ten minutes.
The only tool you'll need is a Torx/Philips screwdriver, which comes with the laptop.
Your battery doesn't hold a charge anymore? You know what to do.
Has it been a while, and you need the latest and fastest -generation processor?
Get a new motherboard, and put the old one into a case designed to convert
Framework mainboards into desktops!</p>
<div class="figure align-center">

<p class="caption">Replaced an old but fully-functioning motherboard?
Why not give it a second life as a mini PC?</p>
</div>
<p>Finally, imagine a laptop with full Linux support out of the box and
a great community of enthusiasts around it!
You clearly see, why Framework laptop is so appealing to me.</p>
<p>What I also appreciate about Framework Computers Inc. is that their
<a class="reference external" href="https://frame.work/sustainability">sustainability</a> page starts with
a big, fat, and honest <strong>&quot;We are not sustainable&quot;</strong> heading.
However, the page explains how the company aims to reduce
environmental impact by creating products that last longer.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-chassis">
<h2>The chassis</h2>
<p>The chassis quality is top-notch.
The light aluminium body and matte glass touchpad
look and feel beautiful! The bezel is made of plastic, but it's customisable
- you can choose from a handful of colours and transparent options.
The keyboard provides good feedback, and is quite comfortable
for long typing sessions. Its backlight is soft and adjustable.
Thin exhaust air vents at the back are a plus when you're using an external
mouse - you won't get your palm fried.</p>
<p>The laptop is warm and rather silent for an x64 machine.
I can comfortably keep it on my lap under light coding/browsing workload
for hours, though it feels like burning compared to an M-series MacBook.
Watching 4K videos boosts the fan and the bottom plate gets noticeably hotter.</p>
<p>The 13.5'' display has 3:2 aspect ratio — that's more vertical space
compared to the widespread 16:9. Perhaps not ideal for watching movies,
but amazing for vertical content: coding, writing documents, reading, and
web surfing. And guess what? The display even comes in two options:
the original 2.2K and the newer 2.8K with higher resolution
and refresh rate.</p>
<p>The battery life is good for me, but there have been plenty of complaints
from the users.
I've restricted battery charging to 80% — this prolongs battery life,
and is more than enough to last for 4-5 hours of light workload, till
the charge drops to 30%. Which can be roughly approximated to 8-10 hours
of full-to-zero battery life — a solid result for an x64 laptop.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<img alt="Framework camera and microphone" src="https://zaurnasibov.com/articles/2025-07-17-framework-laptop-is-awesome/img/camera-mic.webp" />
<p class="caption">Nothing beats hardware switches when it comes to privacy!</p>
</div>
<p>Oh, did I mention that there is a fingerprint reader and there are hardware
switches for the microphone and the camera?</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="using-gnu-linux">
<h2>Using GNU/Linux</h2>
<p>Getting into nerdy stuff — I ditched Windows from my computer back in 2007
and never looked back. So Linux support is paramount for me. It was also the
reason I got the &quot;latest-minus-one&quot; generation laptop — because all the issues
that may surface with the latest and greatest hardware have already been solved
for the previous generation.</p>
<p>I am happy to say, that everything just works. It's been two weeks, and I
had zero problems. Oh, don't get me wrong, I'm still tuning and tinkering
with the setup (after all it's Arch Linux!).
There are issues, like the uncalibrated display, or imbalanced speakers
I've learned about from the fantastic
<a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Framework_Laptop_13">Framework Laptop 13 wiki page</a>.
Luckily, the community has created necessary colour profiles
to improve colour reproduction and equaliser presets to enhance the sound.
There are some other minor annoyances, like display automatic backlight
adjustment jumping in discrete steps, instead of changing gradually,
but all that can be fixed with proper software updates.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="shall-you-join-the-club">
<h2>Shall you join the club?</h2>
<p>Before I say anything, I must make a confession: I like MacBook chassis,
especially the battery-life-to-processing-power ratio.
But I absolutely hate Apple's policies when it comes to
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Hwb5xvBn8&amp;t=958s">the right to repair</a>.
As another example, compare
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/MacBook+Pro+14-Inch+Late+2023+(M3)+Fan+Replacement/167783">this</a>
to
<a class="reference external" href="https://guides.frame.work/Guide/Heatsink+and+Fan+Replacement+Guide/84">this</a>.
So, let's assume you're also not an Apple person and you want a PC.
Should you get Framework Laptop?</p>
<p>A pre-built Framework Laptop is more expensive than other manufacturers'
laptops with similar specs. However, money-wise it's about long-term savings
and voting with your wallet for a sustainable option.
But if you are making this choice, why not go with the more affordable
DIY edition from the start to get the full experience?
You can still get all components and even Windows from Framework.
It'll take you five minutes to assemble the chassis,
and about an hour to install Windows.</p>
<p>And if you're Linux enthusiast or an IT professional — JUST GET IT :)</p>
